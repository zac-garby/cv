		      	\begin{explist}
    		          \item \textit{``Fugue, a Friendly Functional Programming Language with Holes.''}
I designed and implemented a functional programming language, named Fugue, with a novel type system based on Hindley-Milner. The language compiles to an enhanced lambda calculus and supports interactive programming to an extent using holes, and I devised a heuristic for suggesting and prioritising possible hole fills.

Specifically, it worked with 2-player perfect information games, and included a Haskell API for users to define their own games.
